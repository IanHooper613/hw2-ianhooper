Title:  Responsive Portfolio



Purpose:

With over 60% of all webpages being viewed on a device other than a computer, responsive design is becoming more and more vital to individuals and companies.  If an individual encounters obstacles while trying to view a website on his/her smartphone, the indivdual may quickly look for alternatives, resulting in lost web traffic for companies, an potenial revenue as well.
My task was to take my basic html and css skills to the next level and attempt to make a few web pages responsive to different device screen sizes.



Starting off the project:

Visually breaking down the designs of the pages into sections and columns was the starting point of thie project. (Envisioning where to put containiers, divs, columns, etc)


Challenges:

Using some code from Bootstrap, and tweaking this code to align with my ideas for the pages, proved to be challenging.  The back and forth tweaking constantly took the pages in and out of responsive mode. 
Linking the 3 html files to one css file kept me on my toes when naming classes.  



Thoughts:

I believe that manually resizing the Google Chrome browser to different sizes throughout the project helped to reinforce to myself that web pages were in fact responsive.
It would have been useful to check the pages on a smartphone.  Regardless, I think I managed ok.
